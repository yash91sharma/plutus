## What is Plutus?

Plutus is a personal finance and investment tracking platform. It empowers you to understand your financial health through detailed analytics, intelligent insights, and automation.

This guiding principle drives Plutus:

## Project Motivation

There are numerous personal finance apps available in the market, some free to use and some paid. There are also some open sources projects out there. But I decided to create yet another because of the following reasons:

- **Better than Google Sheets**: A dedicated platform offers a seamless and scalable experience, unlike Google Sheets which quickly becomes messy, hard to maintain, and inconvenient especially on mobile. That said, Google Sheets is great and I used it for years before finally deciding to move away. With Plutus, I have the option to create the visualizations which make sense to me, and hopefully to others too.
- **Full Stack Engineering**: I believe full stack engineers is not just frontend and backend development. Becoming a real `full stack engineer` means understanding the entire lifecycle of a product, from ideation, product design, database, backend, frontend, machine learning (training and inference), testing, packaging, deployment, reverse proxy, routing, DNS, certificate management, domain/subdomain configuration, monitoring etc. So in other words, building this app is my attempt to taste all the layers, aka become a `full stack engineer`.
- **Personal learning playground**: Plutus serves as my personal laboratory for experimenting with cutting-edge libraries, packages, and LLMs. It's super interesting to observe how things perform in development versus production. It is fun!!!
