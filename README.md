## Project Motivation

There are numerous personal finance apps available in the market, some free to use and some paid. There are also some open sources projects out there. But I decided to create yet another because of the following reasons:

- **Better than Google Sheets**: A dedicated frontend + backend application offers a seamless, scalable, and organized experience—unlike Google Sheets, which quickly becomes messy, hard to maintain, and inconvenient to update, especially if you're not always working in a web browser. That said, I tracked my expenses and portfolios on Google Sheets for years before finally deciding to build a better solution.
- **Full Stack Development**: Full stack is not just frontend and backend development. Becoming a real `full stack engineer` means understanding the entire lifecycle of a product, from ideation, product design, through database, backend and frontend development, all the way to machine learning (training and inference), testing, packaging, deployment, reverse proxy setup, routing, DNS, certificate management, domain/subdomain configuration, monitoring etc. So in other words, building this app is my attempt to taste all the layers of the cake, aka `full stack development`.
- **Customizations**: No brokerage provides customized graphs and dashbaords, example: what % of your portfolio is exposed to options over time, how much have you earned via selling options over time etc. With this app, I have the option to create the graphs which make sense to me, and hopefully to other users too.
